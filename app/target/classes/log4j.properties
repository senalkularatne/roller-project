# This is a bare bones Log4j setup that is present to catch any unexpected 
# errors that occur before Roller is able to init the logging system defined
# in Roller's built-in properties file and customized (e.g., logfile location
# specified) via your roller-custom.properties override file.
# See the Roller install guide for more details on the standard logfile
# configuration.
#
# This configuration uses ConsoleAppender by default so it will work on
# all installations.  If using Tomcat on *nix systems, or running Tomcat
# as a Windows service, Console appender will write to the Tomcat
# logs/catalina.out file.  See http://stackoverflow.com/a/7752389
#
# Otherwise, you may wish to customize below by specifying a log file
# to write to.  However, such a file will usually remain empty as Roller's
# standard logging is activated quite early in the startup process.
